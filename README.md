# pythonTutorial
A collection of .py files that demonstrate things in python. 

I just wanted to make this because I'm relearning Python after a while and thought it would be cool to share the things that I've learned and compile them into this repo.
You could use this to learn Python if you wanted but the descriptions aren't very in-depth. However, they do give the general gist of things, letting you research everything more in-depth on your own.
Every topic is its own .py file so it should be pretty easy to find exactly what you're looking for.
Anybody that wants to contribute can start a pull request.
